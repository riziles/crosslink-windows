description: Create a worktree and launch a background claude agent in tmux to implement a feature
---

## Context

- Current repo root: !`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Existing worktrees: !`git worktree list`
- Working tree status: !`git status --short`
- tmux available: !`which tmux`
- gh available: !`which gh`
- CLAUDE.md head: !`head -3 CLAUDE.md`
- Project root files: !`ls -1`

## Your task

The user provides a feature description (e.g. "add batch retry logic") and optionally additional context, file references, or constraints. You will create an isolated worktree, then launch a background `claude` process in a tmux session to implement the feature autonomously.

### Arguments

The user may pass these flags after the feature description:

- `--verify <level>`: Controls post-implementation verification depth.
  - `local` (default): Local tests + self-review checklist only.
  - `ci`: Push branch, open draft PR, wait for CI to pass, fix failures.
  - `thorough`: Everything in `ci` plus a structured adversarial self-review using the `/ad` skill.
- All other text is the feature description.

**Parsing**: Split ARGUMENTS on whitespace. If `--verify` is found, consume the next token as the level (`local`, `ci`, or `thorough`). Everything else (before or after the flag) is the feature description. If `--verify` is not present, default to `local`.

### 1. Validate prerequisites

- Confirm `tmux` is installed (`which tmux`). If not, abort with a message telling the user to install it.
- Confirm `claude` CLI is installed (`which claude`). If not, abort.
- If `--verify ci` or `--verify thorough`, confirm `gh` is installed (`which gh`). If not, abort with a message telling the user to install GitHub CLI.

### 2. Create the worktree via /featree

- Invoke the `/featree` skill with the user's feature description.
- Capture the worktree path and branch name from the output.
- The worktree will be at `<repo-root>/.worktrees/<slug>` (inside the repo, inheriting trust scope).

### 3. Detect project conventions

Before writing the prompt, detect what tools the project uses so the child agent gets appropriate instructions:

- **Test runner**: Check for `justfile` (`just test`), `Makefile`, `package.json` (`npm test`), `pyproject.toml` (`uv run pytest` or `pytest`), `Cargo.toml` (`cargo test`), etc.
- **Linter**: Check for `ruff.toml`, `.eslintrc`, `clippy`, etc.
- **Task runner**: `just`, `make`, `npm run`, `cargo`, etc.
- **CLAUDE.md**: If present, the child agent will read it for full project conventions.

### 4. Prepare the agent prompt

Build a detailed prompt for the child agent. The prompt must be self-contained — the child has no access to this conversation's context. Include:

- The feature description from the user
- Any specific files, modules, or code areas the user mentioned
- Any constraints or requirements the user specified
- The `--verify` level that was selected (so the prompt can reference it)
- Instructions to:
  1. **Read the project's CLAUDE.md** (if it exists) for conventions before starting
  2. Explore relevant code before making changes
  3. Implement the feature fully (no stubs or placeholders)
  4. **Run the project's test suite** to verify changes don't break anything (use the detected test command)
  5. Use `/commit` to commit the work when implementation is complete
  6. Review the diff of all changes and fix any issues found
  7. Use `/commit` again after any fixes

**Then, conditionally include the following sections based on `--verify` level:**

#### If `--verify ci` or `--verify thorough`:

Add these steps after the diff review:

8. **Push and open draft PR**:
   - Push the feature branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
   - Open a draft PR: `gh pr create --draft --title "<feature title>" --body "Automated PR from kickoff agent"`
   - Record the PR URL for later reference.

9. **Wait for CI to pass**:
   - Poll CI status: `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 1 --json status,conclusion,databaseId` every 30 seconds.
   - If the run's `status` is `completed` and `conclusion` is `success`, CI has passed. Proceed.
   - If the run's `status` is `completed` and `conclusion` is `failure`:
     - Read the failure logs: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
     - Analyze the failures and fix the issues in the code.
     - Run the local test suite again to verify fixes.
     - Use `/commit` to commit the fixes.
     - Push again: `git push`
     - Wait for the new CI run to complete (repeat this loop).
   - If no CI runs appear after 2 minutes, note this in the status and proceed (the repo may not have CI configured).
   - Maximum 5 CI fix-and-retry cycles. If still failing after 5 attempts, write `CI_FAILED` to `.kickoff-status` and stop.

#### If `--verify thorough` only:

Add this step after CI passes:

10. **Structured adversarial self-review**:
    - Before marking done, perform a thorough self-review of all changes.
    - Review checklist (go through each item and fix any issues found):
      - [ ] All tests pass locally
      - [ ] CI is green
      - [ ] No unintended file changes in the diff (`git diff main...HEAD --stat`)
      - [ ] No debug/temporary code left behind (search for `dbg!`, `console.log` used for debugging, `println!` debugging, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`)
      - [ ] No commented-out code blocks
      - [ ] Commit messages are clean and descriptive
      - [ ] Changes match the original feature description from `KICKOFF.md`
      - [ ] No new warnings introduced (check compiler/linter output)
      - [ ] Error handling is complete (no unwrap() on fallible operations in non-test code, no unhandled promise rejections)
      - [ ] Public API changes have appropriate documentation
    - If the `/ad` skill is available, invoke it for a deeper adversarial review.
    - Use `/commit` after any fixes from the review.
    - Push again if fixes were made: `git push`

#### For all `--verify` levels (final steps):

Add the self-review checklist as the final step before writing DONE (even for `--verify local`, but as a lighter check):

**Self-review checklist** (verify each before marking done):
- All tests pass locally
- No unintended file changes in the diff
- No debug/temporary code left behind
- Commit messages are clean and descriptive
- Changes match the original feature description from `KICKOFF.md`

Then:
- When completely finished, write the word `DONE` to a file called `.kickoff-status` in the worktree root

Write the prompt to `KICKOFF.md` in the worktree root. Ensure it's excluded from git by adding to the main repo's `.git/info/exclude`:

```bash
common_dir=$(git -C <worktree-path> rev-parse --git-common-dir)
grep -qxF 'KICKOFF.md' "$common_dir/info/exclude" || echo "KICKOFF.md" >> "$common_dir/info/exclude"
grep -qxF '.kickoff-status' "$common_dir/info/exclude" || echo ".kickoff-status" >> "$common_dir/info/exclude"
```

### 5. Derive the tmux session name

- Use the feature branch slug as the tmux session name (e.g. `feat-add-batch-retry-logic`).
- Prefix with `feat-` and truncate to 50 characters if needed.
- Replace any characters invalid for tmux session names (periods, colons) with hyphens.

### 6. Launch the tmux session

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s <session-name> -c <worktree-path>
```

Then send the claude command into the session:
- Prefix with `env -u CLAUDECODE` to clear nested-session detection.
- Do NOT use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Use `--allowedTools` for auto-approval after user grants trust.
- Use `--` before the positional prompt argument to terminate option parsing.

Build the `--allowedTools` string based on the `--verify` level:

**Base tools** (always included):
```
Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep,Skill,Task,WebSearch,WebFetch,Bash(git *),Bash(ls *),Bash(mkdir *),Bash(test *),Bash(which *),Bash(touch *),Bash(cat *),Bash(head *),Bash(tail *),Bash(wc *),Bash(diff *),Bash(echo *),Bash(crosslink *)
```

**CI tools** (added when `--verify ci` or `--verify thorough`):
```
Bash(gh *),Bash(sleep *)
```

**Project-specific tools** (based on detected conventions):
- Python/uv: `Bash(uv *)`
- Node: `Bash(npm *),Bash(npx *)`
- Rust: `Bash(cargo *)`
- Just: `Bash(just *)`
- Make: `Bash(make *)`

Concatenate all applicable tool groups into the comma-separated `--allowedTools` value.

```bash
tmux send-keys -t <session-name> "env -u CLAUDECODE claude --model opus --allowedTools '<all-tools>' -- \"\$(cat KICKOFF.md)\"" Enter
```

### 7. Report to user

```
Feature agent launched.

  Worktree: <path>
  Branch:   feature/<slug>
  Session:  <tmux-session-name>
  Verify:   <local|ci|thorough>

  Approve trust:   tmux attach -t <tmux-session-name>
  Check status:    /check <tmux-session-name>

  The agent is waiting for trust approval. Attach to the session and approve the prompt to begin.
```

If `--verify ci` or `--verify thorough`, also include:
```
  CI verification is enabled. The agent will push to origin and open a draft PR after local tests pass.
```

## Constraints

- Never force-push or delete branches.
- Do not push the branch to a remote from the kickoff skill itself. (The child agent handles pushing when `--verify ci` or `--verify thorough`.)
- The child agent prompt must be fully self-contained.
- Leave `KICKOFF.md` in the worktree for reference (git-excluded).
- If a tmux session with the same name already exists, append a short random suffix.
