description: Pre-commit quality gate — review changes before committing
---

## Context

- Working tree status: !`git status --short`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Active session: !`crosslink session status`
- Files changed: !`git diff --stat HEAD`

## Your task

You are about to commit. Run through this structured review to catch issues before they land.

### 1. Review full diff

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

Read through every change. Look for:
- Correctness: does the logic do what it should?
- Edge cases: are boundary conditions handled?
- Security: any injection, hardcoded secrets, or unsafe patterns?

### 2. Scan for stub patterns

Search the diff for patterns that indicate incomplete work:

- `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`
- `pass` (Python), `unimplemented!()` / `todo!()` (Rust)
- `throw new Error("not implemented")`
- Empty function bodies or placeholder returns
- `...` as implementation

If found: fix them now. Do not commit stubs.

### 3. Check for debug leftovers

Search for debug code that shouldn't be committed:

- `dbg!()` (Rust)
- `console.log` used for debugging (not logging)
- `print(` / `println!` used for debugging
- Commented-out code blocks (more than 2 consecutive commented lines)

If found: remove them.

### 4. Run lint and format checks

Detect the project's toolchain and run the appropriate checks:

**Rust** (if `Cargo.toml` exists):
```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

**Node/TypeScript** (if `package.json` exists):
```bash
npx eslint . 2>/dev/null || npm run lint 2>/dev/null
```

**Python** (if `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` exists):
```bash
ruff check . 2>/dev/null || uv run ruff check . 2>/dev/null
```

**Go** (if `go.mod` exists):
```bash
go vet ./...
gofmt -l .
```

Fix any issues found before proceeding.

### 5. Run test suite

Run the project's test suite:

- Rust: `cargo test`
- Node: `npm test`
- Python: `uv run pytest` or `pytest`
- Go: `go test ./...`

All tests must pass before committing.

### 6. Verify crosslink issue documentation

Check that the active crosslink issue has appropriate documentation:

```bash
crosslink session status
```

If working on an issue, verify it has a plan comment and will get a result comment:

```bash
crosslink issue show <issue-id>
```

### 7. Print checklist

Print a pass/fail summary:

```
Review checklist:
  [PASS] No stub patterns
  [PASS] No debug leftovers
  [PASS] Lint clean
  [PASS] Format clean
  [PASS] Tests pass
  [PASS] Issue documented

Ready to commit. Proceeding to /commit.
```

If any items fail, fix them first, then re-run the failed checks.

Once all checks pass, proceed to `/commit`.
