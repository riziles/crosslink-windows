# Changelog

All notable changes to Crosslink will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Design doc for GH issue #367 (#203)
- Integrate pre-flight check improvements for kickoff command: consolidate the inline prerequisite checks in run() and plan() with a unified preflight_check function that adds resolve_timeout_command() for macOS gtimeout support, PreflightResult struct that threads timeout_cmd through to launch_local() and plan(), and detailed platform-specific install instructions. Keep existing tests intact. Reference the worktree version at .worktrees/kickoff-pre-flight-check-for-required-external-commands-e-g/crosslink/src/commands/kickoff.rs for the target implementation. (#151)
- TUI: fix issues tab scroll and improve startup/tab-switch latency. Two bugs: (1) Issues tab scroll is broken - selection cursor moves past visible area but list doesn't scroll to follow, viewport never advances. Fix so selected entry is always visible. (2) Startup and tab-switch latency - noticeable delay on launch and switching to Agents tab from synchronous data loading. Introduce TUI-local cache that populates display immediately with stale/empty state, then updates asynchronously once real data arrives. See GitHub issue #240. (#150)
- Add agent prompting norms for saving research to knowledge repo (#80)
- Phase 4.1: GitHub PAT storage + token management endpoint (GH #429) (#701)
- Dashboard: detect + remedy tracked clones without crosslink init / agent config (#710)
- Dashboard: make alerts clickable to expand with actions (#708)
- crosslink dashboard discover: filesystem autodiscovery of crosslink-enabled repos (GH #429 followup) (#705)
- Write DESIGN-CROSSLINK-OPS.md (GH #429 followup) (#688)
- Phase 5.3: dashboard polish — theme toggle + audible alerts + preferences page (GH #429) (#704)
- Phase 5.2: dashboard webhook alerting — outbound Slack/Discord/generic JSON on alert fire (GH #429) (#703)
- Phase 5.1: dashboard export — projects.csv + alerts.csv endpoints + UI download buttons (GH #429) (#702)
- Phase 4.1: GitHub PAT storage + token management endpoint (GH #429) (#701)

#### Dashboard — multi-project control panel ([GH-429])

- `crosslink dashboard serve` — new SCADA-style panel replacing
  `crosslink serve`'s single-project focus. Aggregates every tracked
  project into one view with live tiles, alerts, and full CLI parity
  for writes.
- `crosslink dashboard track <path>` / `untrack` / `list` — point the
  panel at user's existing project workspaces (no private clones).
- 5-second poll loop per project: git fetch → hub snapshot → counters +
  derived alerts → SQLite persistence → WebSocket fanout.
- Alerts surface: `stale_lock`, `silent_agent`, `overdue_issue`,
  `orphan_subissue`, `unreachable_project` — open/resolve reconciled
  against derived set on every tick.
- Write surface (shell out through `run_cli` primitive; every
  invocation audited to the `actions` table with actor + verb +
  outcome):
  - Issues: close, reopen, comment, block, unblock, relate, label,
    unlabel
  - Milestones: create (with optional description), add issue,
    remove issue, close
  - Locks: claim (with optional branch), release, steal
  - Agents: send control request (kill / pause / resume / reprioritise)
    via the git-native protocol from design doc §9
- Git-native agent control protocol:
  - `crosslink agent request <target> <kind>` writes a signed JSON
    under `agents/<target>/requests/` on the hub branch.
  - `crosslink agent poll-requests` (run automatically every
    `crosslink sync`) translates incoming requests into local
    control flags under `.crosslink/agent-flags/` and writes an
    ack back to the hub so the dashboard shows outcome status.
  - `crosslink agent requests` lists pending/acked requests for
    triage.
- Per-user SQLite index at `~/.crosslink/dashboard.db` with 7 tables
  (projects, project_state, alerts, pty_sessions, actions, activity,
  config).
- React + Vite frontend embedded via `rust-embed`, bundled with the
  binary. New IA: project grid (default), per-project detail (issues
  with inline label chips + comment/label/block/relate drawers,
  agents, locks with Release + Steal controls, milestones with
  create form), /alerts page grouped by severity.
- Deprecates `crosslink serve` — prints a warning pointing users at
  `crosslink dashboard serve`.

`crosslink serve`'s legacy JSON log format is preserved under the
new subcommand for log-scraping continuity.

- Featree skill now uses `crosslink init --force` and `crosslink sync` instead of manual database symlinking for worktree initialization (#42)

### Removed
- Stale `.chainlink/` directory (legacy issue tracker artifacts)
- Tracked `crosslink/.crosslink/issues.db` (should be local-only)

## [0.1.1-alpha.1] - 2026-02-26

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Distributed issue locking and agent coordination, ported from crosslink-enterprise.

#### Agent Identity
- `crosslink agent init <id>` — register a machine-local agent identity (stored in `.crosslink/agent.json`, gitignored)
- `crosslink agent status` — show agent identity and currently held locks

#### Distributed Locking
- `crosslink locks list` — show all active issue locks with stale detection
- `crosslink locks check <id>` — check if a specific issue is available or claimed
- `crosslink sync` — fetch lock state from the `crosslink/locks` coordination branch, verify GPG signatures, display cache path and commit info

#### Lock-Aware Workflows
- `crosslink next` now skips issues locked by other agents
- `crosslink session work <id>` enforces lock ownership before allowing work
- `crosslink create --work` and `crosslink subissue --work` check locks before claiming
- Session start records agent identity in the database (schema v8 to v9 migration)

#### Daemon Heartbeat
- Daemon pushes agent heartbeat every 2.5 minutes to the coordination branch
- Stale lock detection based on heartbeat freshness

#### Hook Enhancements
- `session-start.py` runs `crosslink sync` and displays active locks on startup
- `work-check.py` warns (in strict mode) when working on an issue locked by another agent

#### Init Improvements
- `crosslink init` now writes `.crosslink/.gitignore` to exclude machine-local files (`agent.json`, `.locks-cache/`)

### Claude 4.6 Opus Optimization Epic (#99)

Comprehensive overhaul to make crosslink work seamlessly with Claude 4.6 Opus,
reducing tool-call overhead, improving machine-parseable output, and adding
context-compression resilience.

#### CLI Enhancements
- `crosslink quick` compound command — create + label + work in one call (#100)
- `--json` output flag on show command for structured machine-readable output (#101)
- `--quiet` / `-q` mode for minimal, pipe-friendly output (#108)
- `--work` and `--label` flags on `create` and `subissue` commands (#104)
- `close-all` batch command with label and priority filtering (#107)

#### Session & Context Management
- Stale session auto-detection and cleanup (auto-ends sessions idle >4 hours) (#102)
- Context compression breadcrumbs via `session action` — records last action, auto-comments on active issue, and restores context on resume (#111)
- PreToolUse hook nudges agent when no active working issue is set (#105)

#### Templates & Rules

## Project Goals

Crosslink is designed to be:

- **Lean**: Single binary, SQLite storage, no external dependencies
- **AI-First**: Built for AI-assisted development workflows
- **Context-Preserving**: Session handoff notes survive context resets
